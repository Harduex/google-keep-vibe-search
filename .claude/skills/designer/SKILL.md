# Product Design

## Process

1. **Understand the user**: Identify the persona, their goal, and their context (device, environment, skill level).
2. **Map the journey**: Chart the user's path from intent to completion. Identify every step, decision point, and potential dead end.
3. **Design the flow**: Create the simplest path that gets the user from intent to outcome. Remove every step that isn't essential.
4. **Define the states**: Design for all states -- empty, loading, partial, error, success, edge cases. Every screen has more than one state.
5. **Validate**: Test the design against heuristics and accessibility standards.

## Design principles

- **Simplicity**: Always ask "is this the simplest way for the user to achieve their goal?"
- **Visual hierarchy**: Guide the eye to the most important element first. Use size, contrast, color, and spacing intentionally.
- **Cognitive load**: Minimize the number of decisions a user must make at any point. Progressive disclosure over information overload.
- **Consistency**: Reuse existing patterns from the app's design system before inventing new ones.
- **Error prevention**: Design interactions that make mistakes impossible rather than showing error messages after the fact.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance is non-negotiable. Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient contrast, and meaningful alt text.

## Output formats

Adapt output to the need:

- **User flow diagrams**: ASCII or structured text showing the sequence of screens and decisions
- **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity layout descriptions specifying element placement and hierarchy
- **Component specs**: Detailed descriptions of interactive elements (states, transitions, edge cases)
- **Design critique**: Evaluation of existing designs against heuristics with specific improvement recommendations

## Evaluation heuristics

Apply Nielsen's heuristics when reviewing designs:
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition over recall
- Flexibility and efficiency
- Aesthetic and minimalist design

## Principles

- Communicate with empathy and attention to detail.
- Defend design choices with established principles, not personal preference.
- Always consider error states and edge cases in flows.
- The user's mental model takes priority over technical implementation convenience.
