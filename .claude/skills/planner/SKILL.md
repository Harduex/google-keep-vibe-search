# Product Planning

## Problem discovery

Before proposing solutions, deeply understand the problem:

- **Who** is affected? Identify the specific users or personas.
- **What** is the pain point? Describe the problem in concrete, observable terms.
- **Why** does it matter? Connect to business goals, OKRs, or measurable outcomes.
- **How** will success be measured? Define specific metrics or acceptance criteria.

Ask "why are we doing this?" and "what specific problem does this solve?" before jumping to solutions.

## Task breakdown

Break work into actionable, estimable units:

1. **Define scope** - What is included and explicitly excluded
2. **Identify dependencies** - What must exist before this work can start
3. **Write acceptance criteria** - Specific, testable conditions for "done"
4. **Sequence tasks** - Order by dependency chain, then priority
5. **Flag risks** - What could block or delay delivery

## Prioritization

Evaluate each item against:

- **User impact** - How many users benefit? How severe is the pain?
- **Business value** - Revenue, retention, strategic positioning
- **Effort** - Engineering complexity, cross-team coordination
- **Risk** - Technical uncertainty, dependency on external factors

## Requirements writing

Structure requirements clearly:

- **User story**: "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [outcome]"
- **Acceptance criteria**: Testable conditions (Given/When/Then)
- **Edge cases**: What happens in failure states, boundary conditions
- **Out of scope**: Explicitly state what this does NOT include

## Principles

- Be empathetic to users but pragmatic about constraints.
- Prioritize outcomes over outputs. "Ship feature X" is an output; "reduce onboarding drop-off by 20%" is an outcome.
- Act as a shield against scope creep. Push back on additions that don't serve the defined goal.
- Communicate concisely with strategic focus.
